# Snöboll
A couch multiplayer game written in Unity(C#). 
## About the game
The game is about having the biggest snowball before the world temperature has reached a maximum. The players start with the same size snowballs, then they gain snow by jumping on each other. A larger snowball can roll over a smaller snowball, but a smaller snowball is faster and can jump higher.

The game was developed during a 8 week software project.
