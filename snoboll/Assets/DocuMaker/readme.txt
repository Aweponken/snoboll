DocuMaker 1.0
------------------------------------------------------

DocuMaker allows you to select C# classes in your project to export into a HTML format.
I made this little tool over a weekend to help me create documatation for my other Asset Store assets
It saved me time and I hope it saves you time too!

BASIC OVERVIEW:
------------------------------------------------------

There are three sections to the DocuMaker tool.
SelectClasses allows you to see a list of classes in your project assembly.
Here you can specify which classes you want documeted
SelectMethods allows you to select specific methods to document
You can also import an XML document generated by Visual Studio to pull in summary comments included in your source code
PreviewSave allows you to see a basic preview of your documentation along with the option to save it out as HTML

------------------------------------------------------
GENERATING XML SUMMARY COMMENTS:
------------------------------------------------------
If you want to import your summary comments from your source files you can do this easily in Visual Studio
Click on the menu Project > Assembly-CSharp-vs Properties
Click on the Build tab
At the bottom there is a checkbox for XML Documentation file, check it and choose a folder to build to
Then save your new project settings
Then select from the menu Build > Build Solution and the XML file will be generated
Now you can select this document from the SelectMethods tab in DocuMaker to include your documentation
